# Periodic_Table
So, this is a program where you can find the element with its atomic number also you can search atomic number with symbol and name of element
And I am learning python so if there is any bad in the code feel free to tell me and also code looks bit lengthy bcs of dict but it is just simple and I will do some changes soon .
Thank you!!
